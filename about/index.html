      The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation Plant Transformation Facility was
      established at the University of California at Davis to provide cost
      effective plant transformation and plant cell biology services for the
      plant research community.

    <p>
      Our staff has extensive experience in plant transformation and plant cell
      biology techniques for a wide range of crop plants. We offer
      fee-for-service transformations as well as protocol development in plant
      transformation and cell biology. The facility's staff has extensive
      experience in the development of transformation protocols for species for
      which transformation methodologies are not available or are currently
      inefficient. We also have significant expertise in protocol development
      for a wide range of tissue culture processes including micropropagation,
      plant regeneration, tetraploidization, protoplast isolation etc. Our
      web-based ordering site allows clients to place and track the progress of
      their order on-line.

      This state-of-the-art facility houses six environmentally controlled
      chambers designed especially for growth of plant tissue cultures. The
      facility has a media preparation laboratory equipped with an autoclave,
      Barnstead Nanopure water system, pH meter, balances and a laminar flow
      hood for dispensing media. The facility also has a transfer laboratory,
      which houses four workstations. Each workstation is equipped with a
      six-foot Nuaire laminar flow hood and a computer to allow data to be
      entered into the facilityâ€™s databases directly from the workstation. Other
      major equipment includes: a refrigerated shaker, spectrophotometer,
      refrigerated centrifuges, minus 80 freezer and a Zeiss Discovery
      fluorescent stereomicroscope.

    <p>
      The facility rents plant growth chamber space on the University of
      California Davis campus for acclimating plants to soil prior to transfer
      to the greenhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facility was established through a generous donation from the Ralph M.
      Parsons Foundation.
